# Universal React Applications with Redux

- intro to me
- why this talk?
  - florence tweet
- what we are doing
	- team org
	- sharing views not practical, sharing redux makes sense
- things that were hard
  - extracting web code
		- using rollup to create separate mobile bundle
			- why not just copy source?
				- gives us a chance to catch somethings in the bundle step
					- example: if someone tries to return React.Element or an image in a selector...
		- web vs. JSC/RN env
			- no browser / DOM, no window
			- static config becomes dispatch-init-on-mount
	- sharing thunks w/ different state
		- thunk adapter
		- use middleware for non-business logic
	- teaching / learning js/react/redux
